# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic

# Overview
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning for diagnosing breast cancer. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify tumors as either malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsy data
